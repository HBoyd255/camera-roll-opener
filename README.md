# Camera Roll Opener

<!-- Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 02/05/2024 -->

This is a simple script to open the most recent month's camera roll folder in
the file explorer.

This program assumes that photos are stored in folders numerically representing
their month, within folders representing the year. This program will find the
most recent year and month and then open that folder in the file explorer.

if no photos have been taken this month, the program will open the most recent
month with photos, same with the year.
